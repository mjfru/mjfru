### Hello there, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹
- I'm Matt Frutchey (Fru-shay), a recent bootcamp graduate from Pennsylvania. I studied three full-stacks (MERN, Java, Python) at Coding Dojo, a part of Colorado Technical University.
- I currently have experience in Web Development with HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap, MUI, and Tailwind), JavaScript, the MERN stack, Python with MySQL and Flask, and Java with Spring Boot.
- At the moment, I'm polishing up some projects from my bootcamp experience, doing general algorithm practice, and continuing to review and dive deeper into frameworks and languages.
- In my free time, I'm learning Ruby and actively working to deepen my knowledge in all things JavaScript.
- I have a Master of Science degree in secondary education and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Japanese and am currently employed using both skillsets.
- I am bilingual (English/Japanese) and can also speak Swedish at an intermediate level.
- As a life-long learner, I'm eager to continue to learn within the tech field and am open to employment opportunities worldwide.
- Please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn (link below my picture) or send me an email at mjfru201@gmail.com
